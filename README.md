Speak Easy – AI Conversation Practice

Speak Easy is a full-stack AI-powered conversation practice tool. It helps users improve their communication skills by simulating real-life conversations such as interviews, networking, dating, conflict resolution, and public speaking. Users can select scenarios, choose an AI personality, pick a difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and receive real-time feedback on their communication style. Feedback includes confidence scoring, strengths, areas to improve, and retry or next options.

1) Features

Scenarios: job interview, networking, first date, family conflict, presentation Q&A, social anxiety practice, and more.

AI Personalities: tough interviewer, friendly colleague, professional, skeptical questioner, supportive mentor, intimidating authority, chatty talker, empathetic listener.

Difficulty Levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced, with different AI strictness.

Real-Time Feedback: confidence level, strengths, areas to improve, retry option if score < 90.

Modern Theming: black and pink theme with responsive design.

Secure API: Groq API key is kept private using a Vercel serverless proxy.

Deployment Ready: built with Create React App and configured for deployment on Vercel.

2) Prerequisites

Node.js v18 or later

npm (comes with Node)

Git installed locally

Vercel account (for deployment)

Groq API Key (starts with gsk_)

src/components/
src/components/ScenarioSelector.js

README.md

Important: api/chat.js must be at the repository root inside api. Do not put it under src/.

4) Setup and Installation

Clone the repository from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/
<your-username>/ai-conversation-practice.git
cd ai-conversation-practice

Install dependencies
npm install

Create a local environment file

In the project root, create a file named .env.local

Add the following line
REACT_APP_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

Start the development server
npm start
This will run the project locally at http://localhost:3000

5) API Proxy

The app does not expose your Groq API key directly to the browser. Instead, it uses a serverless function in Vercel.

api/chat.js

This file handles POST requests, sends them to the Groq API using your private key, and returns the response back to the frontend.

Important: This file must always be under the root-level api/ folder so Vercel can recognize it as a serverless function.

6) Frontend AI Engine

The frontend does not call Groq directly. Instead, it sends the conversation messages to /api/chat, which securely proxies the request.

src/utils/aiEngine.js is responsible for making this call.

7) Deployment on Vercel

Step 1: Push to GitHub

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

git branch -M main

git push -u origin main

Step 2: Import into Vercel

Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard

Click New Project

Import your GitHub repository ai-conversation-practice

Step 3: Configure build settings

Framework preset: Create React App

Build command: npm run build

Output directory: build

Step 4: Add environment variables
In Vercel, go to your project → Settings → Environment Variables
Add:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key

Apply this variable to Production and Preview.

Step 5: Configure SPA routing
Create a file named vercel.json in the root of your project and add:
{
"rewrites": [
{ "source": "/api/(.)", "destination": "/api/$1" },
{ "source": "/(.)", "destination": "/index.html" }
]
}

This ensures React single-page app routes work correctly.

Step 6: Deploy

Click Deploy in Vercel

After build completes, you will get a live URL such as https://ai-conversation-practice.vercel.app

8) Troubleshooting

404 not found after deployment: check that vercel.json exists and Output Directory is set to build.

API errors (401 or 500): make sure GROQ_API_KEY is added in Vercel environment variables.

Blank page: confirm Root Directory in Vercel is set to the project root, not src.

Local works but production does not: redeploy after adding environment variables.

Git push errors: if your GitHub repo was created with a README, use git push -u origin main --force to overwrite.

9) Future Improvements

Add more conversation scenarios such as customer support, sales, and debates.

Store user progress in a backend database (Firebase, Postgres, or MongoDB).

Add speech-to-text and text-to-speech for voice practice.

Implement adaptive scoring that adjusts difficulty automatically.
